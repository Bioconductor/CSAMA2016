Please see <http://happygitwithr.com> for all material. Here's the underlying GitHub repo: <https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r>.

Everything in **Installation** should have been done in advance.

-   [Register a GitHub account](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
-   [Install or upgrade R and RStudio](http://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html)
-   [Install Git](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
-   [Introduce yourself to Git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)

Ideally, everything in **Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio** would have been done in advance. In reality, we will spend some time doing / verifying this.

-   [Connect to GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html)
-   One of:
    -   [Cache credentials for HTTPS](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)
    -   [Set up keys for SSH](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html)
-   [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)

Help and troubleshooting

-   [Detect Git from RStudio](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html)
-   [RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell](http://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html)

Slides

-   A subset of these, also in a different order:
    -   <https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user>
-   *I have a reworked version locally and used it for a recent tutorial at useR. I aim to push that to web before this lab actually happens.*

Main and final activity for lab is from **Early usage** section.

-   [New project, GitHub first](http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
-   If time allows, we will practice bringing an existing project into Git/GitHub.
-   Leaves us set up for lab 4 on using R Markdown and specifically using it with Git and GitHub via RStudio.
