Please see <http://happygitwithr.com> for all material. Here's the underlying GitHub repo: <https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r>.

Presumes that alot of installation, verification, and early Git/GitHub/RStudio use has happened. Which we did in a previous lab.

We'll work from the **Workflows** section:

-   [Test drive R Markdown](http://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html)
-   [Render an R script](http://happygitwithr.com/r-test-drive.html)
-   [Make a GitHub repo browsable](http://happygitwithr.com/make-a-github-repo-browsable.html)

There should be time for an independent activity. They can choose from **Tutorial prompts** section of Happy Git.
